# Console Program with Calculator and File Browser Modes

## Description
This program is a console application that runs in an infinite loop and supports three main commands:
1. **'calc'** — switches to calculator mode, where you can perform mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, factorial, exponentiation). Results are saved to a file.
2. **'files'** — switches to file browser mode, where you can browse directories, navigate between them, and read files.
3. **'quit'** — terminates the program.

The program handles errors and exceptions, such as invalid commands, missing arguments, or non-existent directories. The code is organized into modules for better readability and maintainability.

## Features
- **Calculator Mode**: Perform basic and advanced mathematical operations.
- **File Browser Mode**: Navigate directories and view file contents.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid inputs and exceptions gracefully.
- **Modular Structure**: Code is split into multiple files for better organization.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- File and Directory Handling
- Exception Handling
- Modular Code Structure

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the main program file (e.g., `main.py`).
3. Follow the instructions in the console.

## Usage Example
- Enter `calc` to switch to calculator mode.
- Enter `files` to switch to file browser mode.
- Enter `quit` to exit the program.

This project is ideal for those looking to learn about file handling, command processing, and modular program structure.
